# Day 10 of 100 Days of Python
# Project name: Calculator
# Things I learnt: Functions with outputs, Higher order functions, Flags and While-loops

- In the course, the project implements recursion, which coats the code in a calculator function
- If the user type 'n' it will recall the calculator function, which will restart the code
- I will not be using this since its too risky and seems unnecessary
- Instead of using recursion, i'll be using flags (booleans)
- This code will run infinitely, since there are no exit choice
