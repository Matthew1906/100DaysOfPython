#### Day 22 of 100 Days of Python
#### Project name: Pong Game
#### Things I implemented: Turtle, Inheritance, Pong game logic

#### What the program does:
- A mockup to Pong Game
- Link to example: https://www.ponggame.org/

#### The Game is different from the course, since i added a main menu and the ball movement have different logic
#### When the user plays the game in repl.it, it will not work well
